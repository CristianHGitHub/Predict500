ðŸ“ˆ Bull or Bear Day Predictor Delayed
This project uses historical stock price data, moving averages, volume trends, and basic machine learning to predict whether the next trading day will be a bull (price up) or bear (price down) day. The project also includes insightful visualizations and a simple, reproducible pipeline, making it a great addition to a data science portfolio.

ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools Used
Python

yfinance â€“ for downloading historical stock price data

pandas â€“ for data manipulation and feature engineering

NumPy â€“ for numerical calculations

scikit-learn â€“ for model training and evaluation

matplotlib & seaborn â€“ for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook â€“ for step-by-step exploration and presentation

ðŸ“‚ Project Steps
1. Data Collection
We use the yfinance library to pull historical daily stock data (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume) for a given stock symbol (e.g., AAPL or SPY) over a fixed date range. This provides the foundation for our analysis and modeling.

python
Edit
import yfinance as yf
df = yf.download("AAPL", start="2021-01-01", end="2024-12-31")
2. Feature Engineering
We derive additional features from the raw stock data to enhance the predictive power of our model:

Daily Return: (Close - Open) / Open

Moving Averages: 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day averages of the Close price

Previous Dayâ€™s Return: To capture short-term momentum

Volume Change: Percent change in trading volume

Target Label: A binary label indicating if the next day's closing price is higher than todayâ€™s (1 = Bull, 0 = Bear)

This step transforms raw data into meaningful indicators commonly used in technical analysis.

3. Modeling
We prepare a dataset for machine learning by selecting relevant features and splitting the data:

Feature columns: Moving averages, previous return, and volume change

Target column: Bull (1) or Bear (0)

Model: We train a logistic regression classifier to predict whether the next trading day will be a bull or bear day.

Alternative models like decision trees or random forests can also be explored with minimal changes.

4. Model Evaluation
We evaluate model performance using:

Accuracy score: Percentage of correct predictions

Confusion matrix: Breakdown of true positives, true negatives, etc.

Classification report: Includes precision, recall, F1 score

This helps understand how reliable the model is and where it might struggle (e.g., false positives).

5. Visualizations
We create several visualizations to analyze stock behavior and model predictions:

Line charts showing the closing price with moving averages

Scatter plot overlaying predictions (bull/bear) on the price timeline

Volume bar charts (optional)

These visuals make the analysis more intuitive and support the interpretation of predictions.

6. Wrap-Up & Insights
The notebook concludes with a summary of the projectâ€™s findings, including:

Model performance

Limitations (e.g., oversimplification, no economic context)

Opportunities for improvement (e.g., adding technical indicators like RSI or MACD, trying other models)

The notebook is well-commented and includes markdown cells for explanation throughout the process.

âœ… Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple financial indicators like moving averages, volume, and recent returns can be used to build a quick and interpretable model to predict short-term stock movement direction.

It's not intended as a financial advisory tool but rather a practical showcase of:

Data acquisition

Feature engineering in finance

Classification modeling

Financial time series visualization

Perfect as a resume project to highlight:

Machine learning application in finance

Real-world data wrangling

Predictive modeling and evaluation

End-to-end reproducibility in a Jupyter notebook
